SET email ='newemail@mail.com', bio = 'new bio'
WHERE user_id = 2

#DELETE QUERIES
The command to delete rows from the database. 
THERE IS NO UNDO WITHOUT A BACKUP. IF NO WHERE CONDITION IT WILL DELETE ALL ROWS

#delete user 3
DELETE FROM users
WHERE user_id = 3



#ORDER BY and LIMIT
At the end of a SELECT statement, you can change the order and quantity of rows returned. 

ORDER BY name ASC			//Name A-Z
ORDER BY title DESC	   //Title Z-A
ORDER BY date DESC      //most recent date first
ORDER BY RAND()		      //Random order		

LIMIT 10						//maximum 10 records
LIMIT 1						//maximum 1 record

#get the most recent 20 published posts
SELECT *
FROM posts
WHERE is_published =1
ORDER BY date DESC
LIMIT 20
